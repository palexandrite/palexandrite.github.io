So, the soft (or how we call it in informal way — program) does a set of instructions to a computer.

A computer does those instructions and we get a result.

BUT the question is → how the soft is related to the life?

This is a philosophy question and the answer is obvious: we determ what it does in life and how it related to the life.

Thus when people start to think about the soft more then about the life and what the soft should do in the working days what tasks <strong>standing in front of us</strong> then creation of the soft starts resemble the humsters in their wheels :-).

<strong>We</strong> assign the tasks to the soft and I advocate for choosing useful result but not the complexity of architechture.

That is why I would like to offer you to look at domains where the soft could be useful and how to ensure the simplicity of architechture.

Just figure it out.
