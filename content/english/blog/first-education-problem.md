My post today will advance some typical problems in education domain since education is very near to a work nowadays, especially to a work in engineering as it is my lovely domain.

Let’s dive into the next problem. The system of education marks for students. By saying ‘students’, I mean by this not only people in universities and something like universities, but also people at study of some subject.

So, what is the problem? The problem is a student has an object to get better in abilities by education. And when he tries it, he gets labels which are not landmarks to recognize how much he advanced to his object to develop some his ability. It seems to be suppression in his aspirations. I am writing it since you can check if a student studies without marks, he realizes his aspirations in more ease way.

In a conclusion of my post, I would like just to say that there are lots of problems in education domain and I would like to hear from you what is the main problem for you today? What do you think?

Also, I would like to ask you subscribe me to get in touch or send me email about that you want to get in touch.

With big respect, Alexander.
