## Information

The information itself is an observation of movement in the physical universe.
It is transmitted through information carriers, which in this case are called documents.
It could be anything. In a sense of the word, even a computer itself is a document, because it stores information in a certain form.

## Computer

The computer itself is the most that there is a system, which itself is a document containing other documents, which we in the field of computers already call documents.

## Information and computer

The programmer works with information that is somehow in a documentary form (so to speak, in the form of a specific document, as I said above).

<hr>

First, a small digression.

The simplest microcircuit is a closed path along which electricity moves. And if we add another 'path', then this way we get a contour.
That is, this addition is the contour.

<hr>

A computer is essentially a complex chip. And what is interesting is that if we consider an electric current as a wave on which information is located, then any change in the wave itself changes the information.

The programmer writes the program code, which in turn is information for the computer. So it turns out that with the help of the code we create a bypass contour, which changes the information in the way we need.

## What can be assumed in this case?

In this case, we can assume that programmers are dealing with information, and which field works with information, does business?

This is of course infobusiness ;-)

So it turns out that a programmer is also an infobusinessman :-))) ?

But there is of course its own specifics, so it's still difficult to call a programmer an infobusinessman.
