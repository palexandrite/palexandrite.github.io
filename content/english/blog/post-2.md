I was thinking, who is a &quot;pumped-up&quot; programmer?

Maybe it's someone who knows the &quot;cool&quot; words?)

Or maybe he can just work like Jim Carrey)

But It seems that this is a programmer who knows how to apply various methods (technologies) to create working tools for people's lives.

For example, I know different technologies. Such as:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xxl-4 mb-3">
  	<i class="fa-brands fa-php fa-2xl"></i>
  </div>
  <div class="col-xxl-4 mb-3">
  	<i class="fa-solid fa-seedling fa-xl"></i> Yii2
  </div>
  <div class="col-xxl-4 mb-3">
  	<i class="fa-brands fa-square-js fa-2xl"></i> JavaScript
  </div>
  <div class="col-xxl-4 mb-3">
  	<i class="fa-brands fa-react fa-2xl"></i> ReactJS
  </div>
  <div class="col-xxl-4 mb-3">
  	<i class="fa-brands fa-python fa-2xl"></i> Python
  </div>
</div>

There are, however, many others that I know, but these are the main technologies.

Plus, I did several projects from A to Z, as it is said &quot;turnkey&quot;, which included setting up the server (by the way, it is also a separate technology).

Therefore, I consider myself also a &quot;pumped-up&quot; programmer.

And by the way, I am always ready to cooperate, please contact me!
