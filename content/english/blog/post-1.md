AI is an abbreviation which stated for the phrase artificial intelligence.

## Where did AI come from?

In order to figure out where it came from and what it is in general, you need to look a little into the past.

I saw a mention of this AI in the Columbo series already.

And it seems that this topic with AI has already existed for more than 40 years!

After all, the series is dated 1974, and this is not a fantasy series :-) by the way.

Then I have a question, isn't this another hype?
